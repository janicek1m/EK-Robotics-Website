					<h5>Teaching Kids in India</h5>
					<p> In the small village of Manjakkudi, Tamil Nadu in India in December of 2015, we taught children of roughly 10 years old about robotics. They taught kids about NXT with LEGO Mindstorm parts. They taught the kids how they worked and had hands on activities for them. They also taught the kids about SnapCircuts and how they worked.This event was very successful and we learned a lot from the experience. A lot of kids were interested in robotics and we inspired them to learn more about engineering and pursue a career in engineering. </p>
					<h5>Mini MakerFaire at Barnes & Noble</h5>
					<p> Barnes & Noble hosts an annual Mini Maker Faire in which different display booths showcase STEM education and technology. Team members Neha Parmar, David Samolkin, Jason King represented the Emerald Knights and explained robotics and engineering to the future generation of STEM minds. We were offered a booth at the mini Maker Faire where we represented FIRST Robotics and FTC. We prepared a presentation and set up a field and let community members drive the robots around and explained more about robotics and engineering. So many kids seemed interested in our robot. They were especially intrigued in making squishy circuits. Many parents said that they are looking forward to signing their child up for robotics in the future. </p>
					<h5>World Makerfaire</h5>
					<p> At the New York Hall of Sciences Queens, NY, team members Neha, Andie, Dmitry, Preston, Ben, Rachel, David, and Pierce attended World Makerfaire. At World MakerFaire we talked to the 3D printing community about FIRST robotics and how we incorporated many 3D printed parts on our robot that were created using Autodesk Inventor. We also talked to businesses about potential sponsorships. This outreach allowed us to expose the new members of the team to the 3D printing community. We got to talk to many interesting people about 3D printing and we learned more about 3D printing.</p>
					<h5>Creating a Scouting App</h5>
					<p> We saw how for many teams scouting was extremely inefficient and tedious on paper. This was a re-occurring problem, so we created a scouting app that could not only share data about matches between team members, but also statistically analyze data to help teams during Alliance selection based on best shooters, best beacon mechanisms, etc. Our app has spread throughout FTC and many teams around the world use it now. It is also featured on the  New Jersey FTC website. This app will completely simplify the documentation process of scouting and decrease stress during competitions. Rather than making scouting sheets, people can now use the app.  </p>
					<h5>Heritage Middle School Summer Outreach</h5>
					<p>A few of our team members went to Heritage Middle School and provided information to 7th and 8th graders regarding robotics and FTC. Our robot was on display and they told the students about our team. Many middle-school students appeared to be highly interested in how to build and program the robot. For this reason, we encouraged them to join robotics in the future at Livingston High school and many of those same students are members of the team now. This outreach gave us the chance to expose incoming high-school students to the world of robotics. Additionally, this event resulted in many excited middle school students who we encouraged to join robotics in high school. </p>
					<h5>Columbia High School Scrimmage</h5>
						<p>We went to Columbia High School to practice scrimmages with their  robotics team as well as a few other teams in the area. We played a few matches to simulate matches at qualifiers. Both teams made adjustments to their robot and we gave each other feedback on our robots. This event allows us to practice competing with our robot. We also were able to get and give feedback which improve both teamâ€™s robots and practices gracious professionalism. This event also allows us to bond with other teams.</p>
