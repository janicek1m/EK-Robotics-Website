					<p>The Livingston Emerald Knights, Team 10582, is a US FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) team. It is based out of Livingston Senior High School located in Livingston, New Jersey. Our team prides itself in having student members that participate in all aspects necessary to compete in FTC competitions, such as designing, wiring, programming, and building the robot.</p>
					<p> The Livingston Emerald Knights Robotics Team was founded in 2015 and started with just three members. Two years after our establishment, we have managed to grow to over 40 dedicated members. These past two years have been filled with new experiences that have allowed us to grow as both people and as a team. From participation in robotics competitions to spreading STEM, or science, technology, engineering, and math, in the community through outreach programs, we have gone from a small development team to an award-winning competition team. Lead by Andie Weiser-Schlesinger and Dmitry Sambuk with the help of Livingston High School teachers Mr. Novotny, Mr. Micciche, and Ms. 	Atkins, our goals are to improve our building, planning and organization skills, as well as to inspire and spread STEM programs to students around the community. 
						</p>
						<p>Our team teaches students the technical skills involved in creating a successful robot regardless of prior experiences. During Preseason, the focus is teaching new members skills in their area of choice. These new team members may choose to learn about one of the several diverse roles involved in building the robot, such as mechanics, programming, logbook, tech, and business. Returning members help these rookie members in learning the necessary skills to contribute to Team 449. Not only are these skills essential to participating in the FIRST Tech Challenge Robotics Competition, they will also serve the members in whatever career paths they choose to take.</p>
						<p>Outside of the competition season, we focus on reaching out to our local community. One of the core values of FIRST is to spread interest in science, technology, engineering, and math. We demonstrate our robot at various public events, within our school, and in the community. These outreach efforts not only allows us to spread interest in science and engineering, but also give our members a chance to develop their public speaking skills and help generate interest about science and engineering.</p>
